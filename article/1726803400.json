Before the smart power system is implemented, the electricity bill will be calculated by meter reading, and the total electricity consumption will be calculated based on the number of occupants in the dormitory.\nIn order to ensure the process of implementation goes smoothly, students are reminded to recharge the dormitory public card or personal student ID at the convenience store before 12:00 noon on 10/1 (Tue), and then go to the dormitory lobby to top-up through the smart power kiosk.  The topped-up amount of the smart power system will be used for the electricity in the room. For the use of the smart power system and FAQs, please refer to the description of the system.
