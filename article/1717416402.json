Since Building A is no longer usable, Building B will remain open during the summer. However, it is scheduled to close for two weeks at the end of August for the organization of left items and cleaning of the premises. The reopening time will be announced after the new semester begins.\n\nDue to limited seating in Building B, some items left before the earthquake have been relocated. If you find your belongings are not in their original place, please contact the on-site student worker to confirm your identity and retrieve your items. As it is the final exam week, reserving seats with personal belongings is strictly prohibited. On-site student workers will strictly enforce this rule.\n\nBest regards,\nCenter of Teaching Excellence\u003c/pre\u003e\n\t\t\n\u003c/div\u003e"
