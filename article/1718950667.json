This call is aimed at supporting international cooperation in the field of applied research through joint projects of Czech entities supported by TA CR and foreign partners with the expected support of foreign institutions. Its main objective is to increase the quantity of outputs and results in promising areas for the future of the participating countries.\n\nAs a part of this program, the Hradec Králové University team would like to present the project Using AI to increase the cyber resistance and stability of electrical substation control systems.\n\nProject annotation:\nThe goal of the project is to create and visualize a complex data model of an electrical power substation, based on which the characteristics of the standard data flow between individual components will be determined according to the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture and mapped to the Reference Architectural Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0), enabling multidimensional mapping of data and processes in within individual functional layers. This data model will serve as a knowledge base for determining a spatial model of similarity and relational relationships built using appropriate AI models. In the next phase, the model will be enriched with a data view of controlled changes of the complex system of substation control systems, which will create a database of controlled changes in the system based on known influences for the extension of the AI model. These models together with the database of Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture and Reference Architectural Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) components mapped to specific technological solutions and their state information, the created AI model with appropriate visualization will be able to evaluate the real states of the electrical substation and their sub-systems with an emphasis on detection of error behavior caused by, for example, technological or cyber errors and attacks.\nThe entire solution will be technologically verified in the simulated environment of the cyber arena, whose safe and closed environment and specially designed scenarios will allow to expand the knowledge base of AI models of electrical substation systems in a controlled manner, with controlled events in the field of cyber security and operation. As part of international cooperation, the proposed models would then be tested in different environments of energy systems with an overlap in the management of the complex effects of disturbances in the management and distribution of eclectic energy.\u003c/pre\u003e\u003chr/\u003ejpg、png、gif、pdf 附檔縮圖（pdf 只顯示第一頁）：\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align:center;display:inline-block;margin-right:20px;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"./message_7/1718950667/1715776529_Call%20documentation_%208th%20call%20for%20proposals%20SIGMA%20%28Bilateral%20cooperation%29%20%281%29.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"./thumb/1718950667_1715776529_Call documentation_ 8th call for proposals SIGMA (Bilateral cooperation) (1).pdf.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e1715776529_Call documentation_ 8th call for proposals SIGMA (Bilateral cooperation) (1).pdf\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align:center;display:inline-block;margin-right:20px;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"./message_7/1718950667/1715696524_2024_Annex%201%20-%20Specific%20conditions%20of%20individual%20foreign%20organizations_8th_call_SIGMA%20%281%29.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"./thumb/1718950667_1715696524_2024_Annex 1 - Specific conditions of individual foreign organizations_8th_call_SIGMA (1).pdf.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e1715696524_2024_Annex 1 - Specific conditions of individual foreign organizations_8th_call_SIGMA (1).pdf\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\n\u003c/div\u003e",
