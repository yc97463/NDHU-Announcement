As part of this initiative, he planned and hosted the “2024 English Travel Blog Competition: NDHU Campus Tour.” In early April 2024, a major earthquake struck Hualien, severely impacting the NDHU campus. Most classes moved online. After several months of restoration, students have gradually returned to campus for in-person learning. This English travel blog competition, themed “Dong Hwa Campus Tour,” serves as an extension activity for the subsidized course “English Composition (I)” offered by the Department of English. This event also invites students to re-explore the campus, documenting the cultural and natural scenery in English. This initiative also aims to attract international visitors by showcasing the unique aspects of the Dong Hwa campus.\n\nFrom the 24 entries in the competition, after initial and secondary evaluations by the judges, one first prize, two second prize, two third prize, and two superior prize winners were selected. The award ceremony took place in front of the Language Center on December 26, 2024. Among the participants were not only undergraduate students but also master’s students. In addition to Taiwanese students, international students took part in the competition, including those from Belize, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The diverse cultural backgrounds of the participants reflect the multiculturalism and internationalization of Dong Hwa campus.\n\nThrough this competition, the organizer, Professor Yang, hopes that students will continue creating English blog posts, practicing documenting their daily lives and expressing their thoughts in English.\n\nThe list of winners and links to their blog entries are provided below. Let us experience and appreciate the charm of Dong Hwa in the autumn and winter of 2024 through the unique descriptions and perspectives of its students.\n\nFirst Prize winner: Efrain Medina (Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering)\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://ndhublog.mystrikingly.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://ndhublog.mystrikingly.com\u003c/a\u003e\n\nSecond Prize winner: 謝乙仟 (Department of Physical Education and Kinesiology)\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://sincere-whale-mp6p76.mystrikingly.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://sincere-whale-mp6p76.mystrikingly.com/\u003c/a\u003e\n\nSecond Prize winner: 戴妤安 (Department of English)\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://ndhutravelblog.wordpress.com/2024/11/28/explore-ndhu-every-corner-brings-you-a-wonderful-surprise/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://ndhutravelblog.wordpress.com/2024/11/28/explore-ndhu-every-corner-brings-you-a-wonderful-surprise/\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThird Prize winner: Yofrina Octika Gultom (Department of Education and Human Potentials Development)\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://serenityandstudy.wordpress.com/2024/11/28/serenity-and-study-in-heart-warming-hualien/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://serenityandstudy.wordpress.com/2024/11/28/serenity-and-study-in-heart-warming-hualien/\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThird Prize winner: 趙若丹 (Department of English)\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://amy84414.blogspot.com/2024/11/the-national-dong-hwa-university-ndhu.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://amy84414.blogspot.com/2024/11/the-national-dong-hwa-university-ndhu.html\u003c/a\u003e\n\nSuperior Prize winner: 劉坤元 (Department of Education and Human Potentials Development)\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://efficient-seal-mqnl1s.mystrikingly.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://efficient-seal-mqnl1s.mystrikingly.com/\u003c/a\u003e\n\nSuperior Prize winner: 張芷妍 (Department of Sinophone Literatures)\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://discoveredindonghwa.blogspot.com/2024/11/discovering-natural-beauty-of-national.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://discoveredindonghwa.blogspot.com/2024/11/discovering-natural-beauty-of-national.html\u003c/a\u003e\n\n (Note: This competition is organized by the Language Center of National Dong Hwa University, with co-sponsorship from the Center for Teaching Excellence-Triple Creativity Curriculum.)\n\nCaption: On December 26, 2024, a group photo was taken in front of the Language Center during the award ceremony for the “2024 English Travel Blog Competition.”\u003c/pre\u003e\u003chr/\u003ejpg、png、gif、pdf 附檔縮圖（pdf 只顯示第一頁）：\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align:center;display:inline-block;margin-right:20px;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"./message_7/1735782621/2024%20English%20Travel%20Blog%20Competition%20-%20group%20photo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"./thumb/1735782621_2024 English Travel Blog Competition - group photo.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e2024 English Travel Blog Competition - group photo.jpg\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\n\u003c/div\u003e",
