With mental health challenges rising, especially among young adults, and stigma hindering access to help, our research explores how AI can be a pivotal ally in addressing these issues. This presentation will showcase how conversational AI can provide social support and actively reduce social stigma surrounding mental health. By leveraging AI-driven causal models and personalized conversational agents, we reveal insights into how AI can align with user experiences, adapt responses, and support individuals in meaningful ways. Through designed interactions, these AI systems can boost user confidence, encourage prosocial behavior, and provide resonating mental health interventions.\nWe unpack the ethical considerations and challenges in building trust with AI, designing interventions that make a difference, and driving social change through technology. This presentation offers an opportunity to see how AI is evolving from a technical tool into a supportive partner in mental healthcare—empowering individuals, reducing stigma, and fostering societal well-being. Discover how AI can impact our world for the better and be part of the conversation on responsibly shaping the future of mental health support.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://education.ndhu.edu.tw/p/406-1017-233978,r20.php?Lang=zh-tw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://education.ndhu.edu.tw/p/406-1017-233978,r20.php?Lang=zh-tw\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003chr/\u003ejpg、png、gif、pdf 附檔縮圖（pdf 只顯示第一頁）：\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align:center;display:inline-block;margin-right:20px;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"./message_7/1734313591/DFEDE976-AC9A-4F3C-8D1D-FCCB6946008D.png\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"./thumb/1734313591_DFEDE976-AC9A-4F3C-8D1D-FCCB6946008D.png\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eDFEDE976-AC9A-4F3C-8D1D-FCCB6946008D.png\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\n\u003c/div\u003e",
