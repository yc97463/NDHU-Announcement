We’d like to kindly remind you not to drive if you are physically or mentally exhausted. Pay attention to your own physical condition, to avoid any traffic accidents.\n   Take a rest when you are tired. Do not ride or drive too fast or run a red light. Build up a habit of leaving earlier so as not to rush. Safety always comes first.\nTo celebrate the New Year, you might go out and have fun, and use vehicles more than usual. Please note that driving recklessly, without a valid driver’s license or under the influence of alcohol is illegal and subject to serious penalty  by law.\n   Please follow traffic regulations when using any vehicle. Also remember to wear a helmet whenever you’re riding a scooter/motorcycle to prevent any traffic accident. Being a bit more careful means being a bit safer.\n\nStudent Living Services Division\nOffice of Student Affairs\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\t\t\n\u003c/div\u003e",
