Please refer to the Korean visa portal to access the list of eligible countries.\nWhile there is no participation fee, students are responsible for funding and arranging their entire stay.\n\nThe program will run from June 24th to August 30th, offering participants up to 90 hours of lab experience, which can be converted into three credits upon successful completion. \n\nPlease refer to the program outline below for more details:\n - Eligibility : Undergraduate students enrolled at Inha\u0026#39;s Partner University (whose nationality allows for a visa waiver entry)\n - Program Duration : June 24th through August 30th\n - Participation Hours : Up to 90 hours / Max. three credits given (30 hours : 1credit)\n - Lab Offerings (Department / Lab)\n•\tChemistry / Inorganic Molecular Engineering Lab.\n•\tPhysics / Complex Systems AI Big Data Lab.\n•\tMaterials Science and Engineering / Electronic Functional Materials Lab.\n•\tMechanical Engineering, Biological Engineering / Biohybrid Systems Lab.\n•\tMechanical Engineering / Multiphase Flow and Thermal Engineering Lab.\n•\tElectrical and Computer Engineering / Intelligent Embedded System Research Lab.\n•\tElectrical and Computer Engineering / Circuits and Systems Lab.\n\nIf you are interested in applying for this internship program, please fill out Form 1 and submit it along with your transcript of academic records (printed in English) to issa@gms.ndhu.edu.tw\u003c/pre\u003e\u003chr/\u003ejpg、png、gif、pdf 附檔縮圖（pdf 只顯示第一頁）：\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align:center;display:inline-block;margin-right:20px;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"./message_7/1712805224/1.png\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"./thumb/1712805224_1.png\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e1.png\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\n\u003c/div\u003e"
